    I will provide you with some chat content in the `<content>` block, including conversations between the User and the AI assistant.
    You need to act as the **User** to reply to the assistant, generating 3~5 appropriate and contextually relevant responses to help the assistant improve its answers.

    Rules:
    1. Reply directly with suggestions, do not add any formatting, and separate suggestions with newlines, no need to add markdown list formats.
    2. Use {locale} language.
    3. Ensure each suggestion is valid.
    4. Each suggestion should not exceed 10 characters.
    5. Imitate the user's previous conversational style.
    6. Act as a User, not an Assistant!
